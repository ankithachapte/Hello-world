# Hello-world
Just another repository
I am a pre-final year Computer Science engineering student at Sir MVIT. Developing skills on programming in many languages. I'm also a swimmer and a dancer and an active participant in various activities.

I love exploring new opportunities and keep myself updated about the latest inventions in technological aspects. I also love meeting new people, socializing and learn about them. Managerial activities interest me. 

I believe in taking up challenges and try to tackle them as you get to learn a lot from experiences.
